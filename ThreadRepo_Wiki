1. INTRODUCTION
-------------------

1.1 Purpose
threadRepo is a website application that allows users to to purchase and sell clothes online. 
This wiki is a complete collection of requirements for the development of threadRepo. 
These requirements help in the development of the application by giving an outline of the 
priorities to be taken during different stages of development.

1.2 Scope
ThreadRepo Will be an e-commerse web application that is a place for users to buy and sell
apparel and shoes.  Communication between users will be allowed for inquries, and we want 
to give a user friendly approach to enable fast transactions. We want our web application to 
be aesthetically pleasing in order to inhance the experience. 

The user will need to have access to an account in order to buy and sell. Requirements will
include the First Name, Last Name, personal or professional email, What they buy and sell.
Buyers will be given a prompt to enter payment information using paypal and sellers will 
be able to give a price on the product and describe it.  Listing will be available to users
with no profile but will not be able to purchase anything without an account. 

1.3 Overview
threadRepo will be comprised of technolgies featured in the MERN Stack. 
Those technologies being MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
Using these Four technolgies we will full create our website, with all features listed in Scope.
We go into further details in section 2. Description.

--------------------                     --------------------


2.1.1 The Client
The client is our website we created.  This will be responsible for allowing users to
access features on the website which will only be available after they have logged in.
The ability to access these features is done by a user interface which is implemented using
React (Javascript library) and Material-Ui (A React UI Framework).  These will help our web
development process become faster and easier, while creating an aesthetically pleasing web site for 
our users.

2.1.2 The Server
The server is placed between the client and the database.  Here is where we handle user requests.
This is done by using routes that send and recieve information from the client to the webserver where 
our data is then saved in the database.  When a user decides to login or register , this is sent to the 
server side which is connected to the database.The server will also handle any errors that become 
present and are redirected to the client if it is relevant.  Node js and Express js are the server 
side programming languages we are using. 

2.1.3 The Database
MongoDB will be the database that holds our user's information as well as the listings they create.
The user needs to authenticate themselves to access the stored user data in the database, and this is done
by signing in where we will compare the hashed password in the database with the password they input in the front
end(sign in page of website).  As the creators of the website we are able to alter the stored data in the user 
base if needed. This includes altering the specific properties of a listing to deleting an account.


Example Storage of user account & listing in mongoDB :

id: {abclesajip1k3il3234k}
"username": "Iloveclothes",
"firstname": "Bob",
"lastname": "Billy",
"email": "ilclothes@gmail.com",
"password": " *hashed* "


id: {1oslxeiaosphjs2123o}
"username": "Iloveclothes",
"name" : "Bob Billy",
"description": "Pants with tears",
"size": "S",
"color": "light blue",
"condition": "new",
"price": "$15"



Example User login:

emai:
----------------------------
-   ilclothes@gmail.com    -   
----------------------------

password:
----------------------------
-    •••••••••••           -
----------------------------



Example listing:

------------------------------
-           :)               -
-      -  - _ _  -  -        -
-    -  -I      I -  -      -
-   -  - I      I   - -       -
-        I      I            -
-        I------I            -
-                            -
-   BUY                      -
------------------------------

2.2 Users
This website will have a user and an admin.  The user will need functionality 
that is provided from the client.  Some examples include creating an account,
logging in, creating a list, changing profile page.  The users will also need
functionality for communicating with sellers, which the server will need to do
in order transfer the messsage between users.

4. Prioritization
-------------------
The order of priority for threadRepo starts with establishing a functional main webpage, this 
means having a properly layed out design for the site.  There will be some examples of listings
up for a user to view.  Users will also have the ability to create a profile that incorporates 
login capabilities.

The following item in the list of priorities for threadRepo is the ability for users to create, 
delete and edit listings that they created.  This will include having incorporated a database in 
which details about different listings will be stored and modified in.

The next item in the list of priorities for threadRepo will be to the ability for users to view 
their orders and history.  Users will also be able to leave comments on live listenings.

Next item in the list of priorites for threadRepo are some administrative features.  These features
will include those that users are capable of but will include some features that will only be usable
by the admin of threadRepo.

The next item in the priority list for threadRepo is a search/filter ability.  This will allow users 
search for specific items through title descriptions or filter items based on a category of listens, 
price range and a range of other variables.  Users will have the ability to bookmark and share listings.  
Users will also have a comment section that they will be able to interact with.

The next feature in our prioritized features is a peer to peer messaging system.  This will allow users 
to communicate with each other and help a successful transaction among them.  Users will also have the 
ability to customize their own profile pages.

The final feature for threadRepo will be UI/UX polishing and minor tweaks to some of the functionality
of the site.
